# Shell Unit Testing Script
## Disclaimers: 
This is something I drew up rather quickly at 7 am, and I have never worked with shell scripts like this so bear with me. 
<br>
Two considerations before using the code: 
<br>
* all of the cases and results need to be formatted the same way (test_complete_[test number] and test_correct_[test number])
Removing the necessity to format is functionality I intend on adding later, but for now, it means you have some files to format first (or you can write and share your own script that does that!).
* Second, the files given to us do not have the correct results. I got them by first submitting my code, and using the correct responses mimir gave me. This leads me to the second thing to consider: you need for manually create all of the correct testing results. Luckily for you, I have here the correct test results for cases 1-7. 
<br>
One last thing: you might need to change the way the script complies your c++ code. It is set using the compiling command I used.  
## Use
First download the code and the correct results for the test cases. Next, to actually run the program, you need to first execute the line "chmod +x testing.sh". After doing so, you are freely allowed to just start up the program using "bash ./testing.sh"
