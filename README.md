# Shell Unit Testing Script
## Disclaimers: 
This is something I drew up rather quickly at 7 am, and I have never worked with shell scripts like this so bear with me. 
Two considerations before using the code: all of the cases and results need to be formatted the same way (test_complete_[test number] and test_correct_[test number])
Removing the necessity to format is functionality I intend on adding later, but for now, it means you have some files to format first (or you can write and share your own script that does that!).
Second, the files given to us do not have the correct results. I got them by first submitting my code, and using the correct responses mimir gave me. This leads me to the second thing to consider: you need for manually create all of the correct testing results. Luckily for you, I have here the correct test results for cases 1-7. 
## Use
First download the code and the correct results for the test cases. Next, to actually run the program, you need to first execute the line "chmod +x testing.sh". After doing so, you are freely allowed to just start up the program using "bash ./testing.sh"
